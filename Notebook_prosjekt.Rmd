### Task a)

We have S = suspectible for getting infected, I = infected, R = recovered/immune\
After studying the transition probability matrix we can conclude that the different parameters represents:\
$\beta$: The probability of getting infected $S \rightarrow$ I\$

$\gamma$: The probability of getting healty $I \rightarrow R$

$\alpha$: The probability of being not being immune anymore $R \rightarrow S$

### Task b)

With $\beta = 0.01$, $\gamma = 0.10$, $\alpha = 0.005$ we have the matrix:

We further have the possible states {S,I,R} as a result of $1 - \beta$, $1 - \gamma$, $1 - \alpha$ all being grater than $0$. Which means that the chain in aperiodic.

Further we have an finite, irreducible and aperiodic chain which means that we have a stationary distribution $\pi = (\pi_S,\pi_I,\pi_R)$.

If we further try to solve the equations $\pi = \pi P$ and $\sum \pi_i = 1$ which gives us the equations:
